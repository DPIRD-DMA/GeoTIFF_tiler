Assumeing you already have conda installed, you should be able to just run the command below to setup an env with everything you need
conda env create -f geotiff_tiler.yml


if you have changes to your env and need to export the config use this
conda env export > geotiff_tiler_edit.yml

if you are install new packages try to stick the the conda-forge versions such as
conda install -c conda-forge geopandas
